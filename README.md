For this assignment, I was tasked with creating a professional README generator that could be used from the command line. This command-line application accepts the user's input to different prompts about project details and formats them into a readme.md file (located in the "generated" folder) with sections for those details and a table of contents at the top for navigating the file.

In creating this project, I got more experience using npm and the built-in fs module in JavaScript. I also learned more about formatting and creating professional README files.
